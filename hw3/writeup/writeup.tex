\section{Introduction}

In this assignment, we report on the following 3 papers:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \cite{lei2016rationalizing}: \textit{Rationalizing Neural Predictions}
  \item 2
  \item 3
\end{enumerate}

\section{\cite{lei2016rationalizing}: \textit{Rationalizing Neural Predictions}}

\paragraph{What is the model? Roughly how many parameters does the model have?}

\paragraph{What is the latent structure?}

\paragraph{What is the inference approach?}

\paragraph{If they use amortized inference, what is the amortized model? How many parameters does it have?}

\paragraph{What is the training objective?}

\paragraph{What training / inference approximations does the paper make?}

\paragraph{Does the paper evaluate interpretability? If so how?}
